Approximately one person in every 100 will develop diabetes.

6 - 11: Intermediate risk

For scores of 6-8, approximately one person in every 50 will develop diabetes.

For scores of 9-11, approximately one person in every 30 will develop diabetes.

12 or more: High risk

For scores of 12-15, approximately one person in every 14 will develop diabetes.
For scores of 16-19, approximately one person in every seven will develop diabetes.
For scores of 20 and above, approximately one person in every three will develop diabetes.

NB. The overall score may overestimate the risk of diabetes in those aged less than 25 years'''

## Kindly add us on fb www.fb.com/oasisweb ##
## Raindolf, I have updated the sourcecode and removed the 'while' statement,
## it is a loop and I do not get its use in the code.
## I also noticed that there is no result if soft_num is less than 3, so I added one.
## It also crashes when the user enters data that is not a number
